# git-changes

I just want to manage my commit messages.

---

## Why?

i just want to keep track of the changes that I make. Instead of adding many changes at once and then writing a long commit message, I just want to add the each change with a message and then commit them.

---

## Installation

```console
pip3 install git-changes
```

---

## Usage

### Initializing

After installing run the below command in a git repo

```console
gitc --init
```

This command will change the default commit template so that we can add out own commit messages to it.
It will also add the post-commit script.


### Adding changes with messages

### Commit

### Bye...
